
    One of my primary goals with this version of the library was to keep
the price below $50. As more and more people register, several things
have become necessary to continue offering this low price:


1.  Documentation
    --------------

    Documentation is on disk and in a Norton Guides database and all of the
functions are commented internally. (source code included)


2.  Support
    -------

    Support is available by phoning (405)340-1940 during regular
business hours, or by accessing the Super.Lib BBS at (405) 340-4714.

    The BBS runs 24 hours, and is 1200-9600 baud. (Courier HST)
Registered users need only call the BBS and request access.
(Allow 24 hours for full access to the BBS after calling )


3.  Upgrades
    --------

    Upgrade charges after version 1.50 will no longer be free , but
will be based upon the extent of the upgrade, (i.e. how much development
time has gone into the upgrade) with a base upgrade fee of $10.00.



4.  Bug Fixes
    ---------

    Bug fixes will be posted on the BBS, or can be mailed
on request. (With source code included, most minor bugs can be handled
by the programmer!)


5. Business Hours
   --------------

   Business hours are 9AM-5PM (CST) Mon-Fri.
