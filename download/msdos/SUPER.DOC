      ------------------------ Introduction -----------------------------

      Super.Lib Library is a collection of Clipper Functions specifically
      for handling data. They were designed with the following (optimistic)
      guidelines:

        1. Ease of use. Keep parameters to a minimum, and optional.
        2. Data independance. Work with any datafile, anywhere, anytime.
        3. Clean, attractive menu driven interface to the job at hand.
        4. Drop-in to existing applications, requiring little or no setup.
        5. Require no change in programming style by the user.
        6. Leave things as found (colors, screens, etc)
        7. Variable declared PRIVATE unless PUBLIC
        8. Memory variables prefaced with 'm->' to avoid field conflicts

      They don't necessarily succeed in all of these things, but nobody's
      perfect.

      The library was built from the top down, starting with the major
      functions and adding building block functions commonly shared by
      the major functions. It has a particular scope and theme into which
      most of the functions fall, and functions have not just been included
      to boost a function count.

      The library does not even attempt to be all things to all people.
      The most I could hope for is that it provides 'some solutions for
      some people', or at least 'some partial solutions for some people'.

      The best way to get to know the library, is to compile, link and
      study the file SF.PRG.  SF is an all-purpose datafile handler that
      will do everything from Create/Modify structure to Browsing a file
      to Querying and Printing a file. SF.PRG makes use of most of the
      metafunctions, and should give a pretty good idea of their scope.


      ------------------------ License ----------------------------------------

      You are granted the right to use this program on a trial basis for
      as long as you like.

      Registration is required prior to use of Super.Lib Library in
      distributed executable programs.

      Super.Lib Library may not be incorporated into other Libraries.

      I encourage you to upload the shareware version of the library to
      bulletin boards you frequent, as long as the full shareware version
      and all shareware files are uploaded.


      ------------------------ Registration -----------------------------------

      See ORDER.DOC for ordering details.

      Registration entitles you to a full Clipper/C/ASM source code for
      Norton Guide datafile, 24 hour Super.Lib Support BBS access ,
      notification of additional Super.Lib products when available,
      and use of the library in distributed executable applications royalty
      free.

      Registration does not entitle you to distribute, sell or even give
      away the library itself ,the source code, portions of the
      library or source code, or modified copies of the library or
      source code. You may not use the library to create another
      library which you then distribute, for profit or not.
      In short, any portion of the library going FROM you TO anyone else
      must be in compiled executable format (.EXE), and may not be in
      source code or object format.

      --------------------Super.Lib Professional-----------------------------

      Super.lib Professional, a new product from Functional Software
      is now available. This is a commercial product, and is not
      available as shareware.

      Most of the Metafunctions  have been enhanced considerably, and
      numerous NEW functions have been added, both small and large.

      Some of my favorite enhancements:

      BUILDEX point and shoot expression builder. Build expressions
      like left(FNAME+LNAME,30)+','+MI.  With hooks into QUERY, BLDNDX
      (index builder) and Super Report Writer.

      VIEWPORT data entry engine. Pass arrays for fields, field
      descriptions, pictures, valids, lookups, display/edit. Multiple
      movement,search,view and editing options. Goes far beyond the
      DOITALL function in Superfunction Standard. End users love it!

      QUERY now handles: memo fields, complex expressions (BUILDEX),
      spaces as comparison values, wildcard matching, startswith,
      endswith and does not contain operators.

      PRNPORT allows user to select printer port. Hooked into the
      form letters, labels, listing and other Superfunction routines
      that output to the printer.

      TODOLIST, scroll a subset of a DBF with SMALLS, SEARCHME mini
      query, BLDNDX complex index builder, FREQANAL frequency
      analysis, TIMEPER time-sensitive DBF analysis, APPENDIT intelligent
      APPEND FROM replacement ,POPUP CALCULATOR and CALENDER, delete and
      pack system DBFs (queries, forms) with PURGEM, many new DATE and
      STRING functions, no calls to Clipper internals, Blinker-able,
      Clipper 5.0 compatible.

      Attention has also been paid to date sensitive operations, and
      all date formats (ANSI-GERMAN-FRENCH-BRITISH-ITALIAN-AMERICAN)
      are supported.

      REPORTER. The Super Report Writer is a column based, 100% Clipper
      code, linkable Report Writer intended as a CREATE REPORT replacement
      and superset.

        - saves report definitions to a DBF file.
        - up to 34 columns as field names or complex expressions.
        - user definable column widths, column titles, column separator
          characters, line separator characters, totals underline
          characters , picture, page dimensions and others
        - Major and Minor groups, subtotals, totals and grand totals
        - full or summary report
        - print against QUERY or TAGGED records
        - free form headers and footers 1-9 lines
        - print to printer or file, pause during printing, restart
          from page #

      and finally, the library comes with...
      100+ page printed manual, upgrade guide for 1.50 users, Norton
      Guide database, 1 year support, 24 hour BBS access, and ... FULL
      SOURCE CODE!!

      acknowledge your agreement with all of the above conditions.

      ------------------- Linking Super.Lib Library ---------------------

      Where <program> refers to your OBJ file(s) ,<other libs>
      refers to other Libraries you may wish to use, and

      Turbo Link (Tlink) :
      TLINK <program>,,,clipper + extend + <other libs> +  super

      Microsoft Link    :
      LINK <program>,,,clipper,extend,<other libs>,super /NOE /SE:512

      Plink86           :
      PLINK86 fi <program> lib clipper,<other libs>,super,extend

      BLINKER           :
      BLINKER fi %1 lib super,clipper,extend

      Only those functions actually called by your prg - and any they call -
      will be included in your EXE. The metafunctions will  be big - usually
      5-10K.

     --------------Video Compatibility -----------------------------------

     Super.Lib Library uses a few direct video routines,
     for fast screen writing. As such, it will only work with IBM (tm)
     PC compatible computers. It has been tested on Mono, CGA and
     EGA adaptors, although some CGA adaptors will display 'snow'.

     -------------------- Colors scheme for this library -------------------

      This is not the perfect color scheme. It is the one this library runs
      on. Several global color variables are used by the functions. These are:

                c_normcol       -       For normal input/output
                c_normmenu      -       For normal 'menu to' operations
                c_popcol        -       For popup box colors
                c_popmenu       -       For popup box menus
                c_frame         -       Frame string ("ÚÄ¿³ÙÄÀ³ ")
                c_shadatt       -       Shadow color attribute (numeric)
                c_shadpos       -       Shadow position (0,1,3,7,9)
                c_xplode        -       Logical - explode windows?

      All are of the format "f/b,f/b,,,f/b"  (f-foreground b-background)

      The function INITCOL() will set these colors, and is called if they
      have not already been set.The function INITSUP() is used to initialize
      everything needed by the Library. Initsup() calls initcol() if needed.

      The function SETCOLORS() allows interactive setting of these colors.
      The variables are stored in COLORS.MEM - which is created if needed.
      If COLORS.MEM is not present, default colors are used.

       ------- Calling Super.Lib with related files -------------

       Many of the Super.Lib functions will work with a many-to-one relation.
       When passing the array of field names, place the child fields in
       the array as "alias->field"

       i.e.
               declare customer[10]
               customer[1]="LNAME"
               customer[2]="FNAME"
               ....
               ....
               customer[9]="AGENT->AGENTNAME"
               customer[10]="AGENT->ADDRESS"

       query(), lister(), doitall(),lookfld(),formletr(),smalls() are some
       of the functions which allow this.

       One-to-many relations are not supported.

      ------------------- Multiuser ---------------------------------------

      The library has NOT been tested under a multiuser environment, and no
      attention has been paid to this aspect. I do not expect to have such an
      environment set up any time real soon, and so do not expect this library
      to be multiuser any time real soon.

      ------------------- CLIPPER 5.0--------------------------------------

      Super.Lib is now compatible with Clipper 5.0 (pre-release 06-29-1990)
      As of this writing, there are a few incompatibilities between
      Clipper S87 and Clipper 5.0. I've worked around these known
      incompatibilities. The .PRGs will compile and link with 5.0 and
      RTLINK. The .EXEs will run. My intention at present is to keep
      the library compatible with both Summer 87 and 5.0 versions of
      Clipper.

      Note: It is necessary to re-compile the source code with Clipper 5.0
      in order for the library to work with Clipper 5.0.
