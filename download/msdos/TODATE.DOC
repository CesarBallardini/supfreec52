(LATEST CHANGES FIRST)
DATE            PRG/FILE        CHANGE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

06-26-1990   VERSION 1.51

        FORWARD
        -------
        Many of the changes in version 1.51 were done to make the
        library compatible with Clipper 5.0, as well as Clipper S87.
        Some functions were removed due to calling Clipper internals,
        which are version dependant and would not work in Clipper 5.0.

        Some functions have been replaced by better functions which
        perform the same task. Two functions (AUTOSTOR() and AUTOREP())
        have been removed due to memory fragmentation problems they
        created.

             S_AUTOS.PRG     AUTOSTOR()    | Memory fragmenter
             S_AUTOR.PRG     AUTOREP()     | "               "
             S_MAKEW.PRG     MAKEWIND()    | replaced by MAKEBOX()

        FIXED/CHANGED SINCE RELEASE OF 1.50
        -----------------------------------

06-25-1990   S_FGETLE.PRG    New function FGETLEN() gets the length
                             of a field from the current database.

             S_STAN.PRG      These replace clrs.c, and contain the
             S_ENHAN.PRG       functions STANDARD(), ENHANCED() and
             S_UNSL.PRG        UNSELECTED(). Previous method used
                               Clipper internals.

             S_FULLD.PRG     The FULLDIR() function has been revised
                             to do all of its work with arrays, skipping
                             the DIRS.DBF step.

             SUPER_C.FUN     Now contains full listing of all C/ASM
                             functions.

                             --------------------------------------
06-24-1990   S_MSG.PRG    ---|   Alright, I was wrong. These have
             S_PLSW.PRG      |   been changed back to pop up using
             S_BLDNDX.PRG    |   C_POPCOL as the default color.
             S_DELET.PRG     |
             S_FILER.PRG     |   Pass the crow.
             S_FULLD.PRG     |
             S_MCHOI.PRG  ---|
             S_MENUV.PRG     |
             S_MFLD.PRG      |
             S_ONER.PRG      |
             S_POPEX.PRG     |
             S_SCROLL.PRG    |
             S_TAG.PRG       |
             S_MESSYN.PRG ---|
                             --------------------------------------

06-24-1990   S_OCCUR.PRG     Was allowing MEMO field selection and
                             crashing

02-24-1990   S_SMAL.PRG      Was incorrectly closing lookup file
                             when passed a numeric work area.


01-23-1990   S_ISLOAD.PRG    New function to determine if <PROC> is
                             loaded.
             S_GENED.PRG     Fixed (s'far as I can tell) the memo
                             field overwrite problem and the alias->field
                             recognition problem.
             SF.PRG          Fixes small problem BETA testers were
                             experiencing with new PULLDOWN() and ESC key

01-22-1990   S_SMAL.PRG      Fixed invisible cursor problem some
                             people were experiencing. BETA people
                             get this one for DATAENT() testing.
             S_LIST.PRG      Sets console back on when done.

                             --------------------------------------
01-17-1990   S_MSG.PRG    ---|   These were all changed to default
             S_PLSW.PRG      |   to the CURRENT color rather than
             S_BLDNDX.PRG    |   the variable C_POPCOL.
             S_DELET.PRG     |
             S_FILER.PRG     |   In those cases where you need a
             S_FULLD.PRG     |   different color than the current
             S_MCHOI.PRG  ---|   color, simply do something like:
             S_MENUV.PRG     |
             S_MFLD.PRG      |    oldcolor = SETCOLOR(m->c_popcol)
             S_ONER.PRG      |    <popup function call >
             S_POPEX.PRG     |    SETCOLOR(m->oldcolor)
             S_SCROLL.PRG    |
             S_TAG.PRG       |   or pass the color as a parameter
             S_MESSYN.PRG ---|   where that is an option.
                             |
                             |   I have had many requests to do
                             |   this, so now it is done. (I suppose
                             |   that now I will have many complaints
                             |   for having done it!)
                             --------------------------------------


01-11-90     S_MSG.PRG       Optional timeout parameter instead of 'Press
                             a key'


12-26-89     S_CLAB.PRG      CLABEL() validation of label contents
                             was not working. Jeff Beaver pointed me
                             in the right direction re: using an array
                             element in a valid, and now its fixed.

12-25-89     S_SMAL.PRG      Fixed to accomodate varying string length
                             results and trim to size of box . (i.e.
                             for passed expression of TRIM(lname) )

             S_MCHOI.PRG     Added optional parameter to pass array
                             by reference instead of as name of an
                             array.

12-24-89     S_PULLDN.PRG    Added optional parameter for overiding
                             menu title column settings.

12-21-89     The documentation has been improved.

             1. Each .PRG now has a header containing '
                 Function            function name
                 Action              action performed
                 Returns             returned value
                 Category            general category
                 Syntax              standardized syntax
                 Description         description of usage
                 Options             optional parameter usage
                 Examples            at least 1 example per prg
                 Notes               general notes
                 Warnings            warnings, dangers, gotchas

             2. This header is used as the basis for the Norton Guide
                and datafile, as well as the function
                lists (SUPER.FUN).



             SUPER.FUN       |Function list - improved/expanded
             ALPHA.FUN       |Alphabetical list
             SUPER.DOC       |General documentation - improved/expanded
                             (all available in DOCS.EXE)

             SUPER.NG        Much improved and expanded Norton Guides
                             datafile (available in NORTON.EXE)


             -[prg changes]--------------------------------------

             S_MODIS.PRG     Closed an open If statement in top module
                             Removed reference to AUTOSTOR() AUTOREP()
             S_PULLDN.PRG    Added m-> to kounter 'i'
             S_MCHOI.PRG     Added m-> to kounter 'i'
             S_ABORT.PRG     Added optional parameters for box color
                             and box dimensions
             S_BLDARR.PRG    Added option to pass array directly,
                             avoiding macro expansion
             S_BLDBF.PRG     Added option to pass array for DBF
                             description



11-29-89     S_FILER.PRG     Finally found and fixed FILEREAD()'s inability
                             to list the last line of a text file.
11-26-89     S_LIST.PRG      Nick Scallorn pointed out that LISTER() was
                             not deselecting fields in the same order in
                             which they had been selected.
                             This was due to an ommitted ADEL() at line
                             209 in S_LIST.
                             There was also a problem with selecting ALL
                             fields and then trying to DESELECT - due to
                             the bug in Clipper's ADEL() that will not
                             allow deletion of the last array element.
11-24-89     S_SMAL.PRG      Added some parameters - work area/alias,
                             KEYBOARD expression, beginning/ending record
                             number, beginning/ending expression.
             S_GENED.PRG     Took out AUTOSTOR() and AUTOREP() as it has
                             been pointed out that these tend to fragment
                             memory. Also enhanced GENED's ability to handle
                             related fields in the field list array.
             S_LIST.PRG      As pointed out by Don Trudeau, query matches
                             were not matching - this was due to SET EXACT
                             ON within the LISTER() function. EXACT is now
                             set on only where needed, and QUERY finds what
                             one might expect it to. (Query really needs a
                             'begins with')

             SUPER.NG        Just did some touching up. Moved the text
                             more towards the left side

             SUPER.DOC       Added a section on using RELATED fields with
                             superfunctions in many-to-one situations.

11-07-89     S_MODIS.PRG     Added field EXISTING to structure extended
                             dbf to allow marking of existing fields, so
                             warnings about 'changing existing field *'
                             would only sound on existing fields
11-02-89     S_GLOBR.PRG     Was bombing if memo field selected
                             Removed 'available only in registered..." msg.
             S_CLAB.PRG      Removed 'available only in registered..." msg.
             S_INIT.PRG      Removed 'available only in registered..." msg.
             S_DUP.PRG       Removed 'available only in registered..." msg.
             S_PRINT.PRG     Removed 'available only in registered..." msg.
                             Now allows escape from reporting
                             Erases .999 file on exit
             S_QUERY.PRG     Removed 'available only in registered..." msg.
             S_FORML.PRG     Removed 'available only in registered..." msg.
             S_MESSYN.PRG    Now calls INITSUP()
             S_PULL.PRG      Handles lowercase
             S_EDIT.PRG      Handles lowercase
             S_MODIS.PRG     Does not allow editing numeric field to a
                             less length (results in numeric overflow
                             otherwise)

10-19-89     S_FORML.PRG    Made adjustments to allow for left margin
                            setting when printing (was causing a double
                            space effect)
                            Added more checks for ESCAPE while printing
                            Query should now work properly for formletter
                            printing
10-14-89     SF.PRG         Mispelled 'modifying'.
                            scroll() used to clear bottom box was not
                            clearing entire box, resulting in the DBF name
                            remaining even after the dbf had been closed
                            (i.e. after modify structure).
             S_HELPM.PRG    Added restore previous color
             S_EDIT.PRG     Added save/restore cursor status
             S_DOALL.PRG    Added save/restore cursor status


9-28-89      S_INITC.PRG    |All minor changes to handle a bug re: saving
             S_SETCOL.PRG   |and restoring frame/shadow settings
             SF.PRG         |

9-21-89      S_INITC.PRG     fixes problem when a 1.50 compile program finds
                             a 1.42 COLORS.MEM (makebox line 55 etc etc)

             S_DUP.PRG       fixes sporadic problem encountered when
                             attempting to open same DBF in two areas at
                             once. NOW REQUIRES RE-OPENING OF INDICES
                             AFTER A CALL TO THIS FUNCTION.\

             SF.PRG          Re-opens indices after call to DUPLOOK()
                             (see above)

9-20-89      S_SCROLL.PRG    fixed to only do first letter lookups if
                             index is character type.
                             was confused at points about what title to use

9-12-89      S_LIST.PRG      2nd generation of PRNTLST(). Uses more arrays
                             and less macros. A lot easier to follows.
                             Its also about 3 K smaller (.obj)


9-9-89       SF.PRG          this is what CB is now called. Also handled
                             setting of controlling index to 1 initially

             S_INITC.PRG     not restoring from COLORS.MEM

             S_PRINT.PRG     if called with 2nd array for DESCRIPTIONS,
                             and list is saved, was unable to restore
                             list.

             S_CLAB.PRG      label printing routing now trims out
                             empty lines from labels (i.e. a 2nd address
                             line). Also removes multiple spaces from
                             a line, thus allowing an entry of

             S_PULLDN.PRG    final restscreen() was using fixed settings
                             instead of the new boxdata[] parameters, thus
                             erasing top of screen in some cases.

8-28-89      S_SMALL.PRG     fixed to only do first letter lookups if
                             index is character type

             S_CLAB.PRG      used readinsert(.f.) before doing a KEYBOARD
                             (in Contents editing) to eliminate double entry
                             new screen design (ala Dennis Levin)
             S_BLDNDX.PRG    if index string goes beyond one line, now
                             properly displays it on next line, rather
                             than overwriting first line
             CB.PRG          pick_ndx() now allows 6 max indices picked
                             and then exits
